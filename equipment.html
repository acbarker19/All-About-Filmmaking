				<h1>Camera</h1>

				<h2>Professional Video Camera</h2>
				<p>The most essential part of filmmaking is, of course, a camera. While any camera can 
					be used to make a movie, you do need a professional-grade camera if you wish to share
					your movie on the big screen. There are many options to use, and they will oftentimes
					be expensive to buy. Many indie filmmakers will rent a professional camera to save
					money. Professional video cameras will offer better film resolution, oftentimes shoot
					in RAW file format (which allows for better color correction in post-production), and
					has a well-made built-in microphone. The camera shown here is the
					<a href="http://www.red.com/store/products/scarlet-w-5k-brain">RED Dragon</a>, an
					expensive but popular choice in professional filmmaking.</p>

				<h2>DSLR Camera</h2>
				<p>For lower-budget movies and short films, some filmmakers decide to use DSLR cameras.
					While these cameras are mainly designed for taking still photos, many nowadays also
					shoot high-quality video. With the benefit of swappable lenses and a lot of control
					over visual settings, these cameras are a large step-up from simple point-and-shoot
					cameras. They are also much more affordable. For example, the
					<a href="https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/products/details/cameras/dslr/eos-rebel-t5i-ef-s-18-55-is-stm-kit">
					Canon EOS Rebel T5i</a> and <a href="http://www.nikonusa.com/en/nikon-products/product/dslr-cameras/d3300.html">
					Nikon D3300</a> are two of the most popular entry-level DSLRs, and they are priced
					$450-$600 new, and much cheaper when refurbished. The only cons to using a DSLR are
					that they are not specifically designed to film video. Many require an external
					microphone to record quality audio, and many only film up to 29 minutes and 59 seconds
					worth of video at a time (this is to avoid being considered a "video camera" and
					paying larger tariffs in the European Union).</p>

				<h1>Camera Stabilizers</h1>
				<img src="images/tripod.jpg" alt="Tripod" align="right"
					style="width:14%; height:14%;" hspace="20">
				<h2>Tripod</h2>
				<p>Many scenes require a steady shot that does not move in any way. This is where a
					tripod comes in. Tripods are a useful tool when the camera is not moving and you are
					focusing on a subject that is (usually) not moving. Tripods can be inexpensive, or
					they can be very expensive, depending on how durable you want it and with how many
					features. While on a tripod, the camera doesn't move, but most allow for panning
					(discussed on the "Filming" page).</p>

					style="width:12%; height:12%;" hspace="20">
				<img src="images/gimbal.jpg" alt="Gimbal" align="left"
					style="width:15%; height:15%;" hspace="20">
				<h2>Steadicam/Gimbal</h2>
				<p>Steadicams (left) and gimbals (right) allow a cameraman to walk around a set and
					film with little noticeable effect. These items will stabilize the camera and
					create smoother movements when walking. If you film a video without a steadicam
					or gimbal, you can oftentimes see jagged movements with each footstep the
					cameraman takes. These products eliminate this effect to varying degrees and
					make movement less noticeable.

				<img src="images/dolly.jpg" alt="Dolly" align="right"
					style="width:30%; height:30%;" hspace="20">
				<h2>Dolly</h2>
				<p>Dollies move the camera in simple, extremely smooth movements around the set.
					Dollies consist of a cart with wheels that the camera attaches to and oftentimes
					there are a set of tracks for it to glide on. Dollies are very much like tripods
					on wheels, allowing for even less jagged camera movement than steadicams and
					gimbals. In fact, some dollies allow you to put a tripod on top of them.</p>

				<h1>Lighting</h1>
				<img src="images/light_stands.jpg" alt="Light Stands" align="right"
					style="width:23%; height:23%;" hspace="20">
				<img src="images/reflectors.jpg" alt="Reflectors" align="right"
					style="width:25%; height:25%;" hspace="20">
				<h2>Lights and Reflectors</h2>
				<p>Lighting is an important part of filmmaking, especially when filming in a studio
					or indoors. Therefore, portable lighting units are used to add artificial light
					exactly where needed. However, it doesn't always look great if the lights are
					pointed directly at a subject. Sometimes a softer light is needed. This is where
					light reflectors come into play. The light is shined at the reflector and bounced
					back at the subject. This adds more light to the subject, but it is not very
					harsh to look at.</p>

				<h1>Sound</h2>
				<img src="images/boom_mic.jpg" alt="Boom Microphone" align="left"
					style="width:20%; height:20%;" hspace="20">
				<h2>Boom Microphones</h2>
				<p>Many professional filmmakers use boom microphones for their audio. These
					microphones pick up very clear sound and are generally placed closer to the
					actors than the camera, which allows them to record audio at a louder volume.
					These microphones also allow for actors to move around when they speak without
					fear of their voices growing louder or quieter when picked up by the camera.
					With a boom microphone, actors' voices will have a constant volume that allows
					for easier sound editing and less reshoots.</p>
