# All About Filmmaking

A small website that explains various aspects of filmmaking. It contains a home page, a page about filmmaking equipment, a page about movie pre-production, a page about the actual production of a movie, and a page about a movie's post-production.

It was the final project for my first web design class (CSW113) at the University of Mount Union.
