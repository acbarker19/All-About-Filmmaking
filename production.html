							<h2>The Golden Ratio</h2>
							<p>The Golden Ratio is a way of filling a shot by starting with a tiny
								object and as an imaginary line spirals outwards, the objects grow
								larger. The Golden Ratio is a visual representation of the Fibonacci
								Sequence and is something many photographers and filmmakers have
								noticed in nature.</p>

							<h2>The Quadrant System</h2>
							<p>The quadrant system is a way of splitting the frame into fourths and
								only working in certain quadrants. As you can see in the still image
								on the left from <i>Drive</i>, only the top-left and the bottom-right
								quadrants are lit, and we naturally look at them anyway because they
								have a character in each. The Quadrant System may also be used to
								center an image in the middle of the frame.</p>
						</td>

					<tr>
						<td>
							<h2>The Rule of Thirds</h2>
							<p>This is probably one the most used composition in filmmaking and
								photography. You split the image into ninths and try to put your
								subject on one of the intersections of the lines. This puts the
								subject in one-third of the frame, and the other two-thirds show
								where the subject is. This framing becomes very noticeable in
								conversations between two people, but is also used in many other
								situations.</p>

						</td>
						<td width = "35%">
							<p>The 180&deg Rule refers to the 'rule' that while filming two characters or
								objects, you should film only on one side of them. You should make
								an imaginary line between the two items and stay on one side of it,
								unless you actually show the camera moving to the other side. This
								is to avoid confusion from the audience on where objects are located.
								Also note that the composition follows the Rule of Thirds.</p>

				<h1>Framing</h1>
				<table>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<p>There are many forms of framing that serve a lot of different purposes.
								For example, wide shots are most commonly used to show location, 
								while closeups show characters' emotions and can build tension and
								suspense. A list of some of the commonly used ways of framing are
								shown in the image to the right.</p>
